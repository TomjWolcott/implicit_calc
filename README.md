This project is largely abandoned (I might pick it back up IDK) and is very jank in its current state.  Feel free to fork it, 
improve it, and make it your own! Also technically it only supports up to 6D right now, but this is just a UI limitation, not 
a problem with the engine.

# N-d Implicit Equation Graphing Calculator

A graphing calculator, kind of trying to mimic desmos, for implicit equations in higher dimensions.  This renders the 
cross-section of the higher dimensional object with the viewing hyper-plane (volume?).  The stripes on the objects are 
there to help you see the objects shape.
